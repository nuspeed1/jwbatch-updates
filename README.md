# jwbatch-updates
Some helper scripts to perform CRUD commands in bulk. 

# SETUP
Requires setting up a Python3 virtual environment.

Create a folder to contain your virtual environment libraries
> example: 
> ```
> $ mkdir ~/venv
> ```

Created the virtual environment
> example: 
> ```
> $ python3 -m venv ~/venv
> ```
Activate the environment
> example: 
> ```
> $ source ~/venv/bin/activate
> ```
Navigate to the folder where this repo was cloned.
> example: 
> ```
> $ cd ~/jwbatch-updates
> ```

Install requirements
> example: 
> ```
> $ pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

## Make sure a ./files directory exists at the same level as all scripts.  This is where generated files are stored. 

Now you are ready to use any of the scripts.  Read instructions at the top of each file to usage each script. 
Keep in mind all scripts require the utils.py file.
